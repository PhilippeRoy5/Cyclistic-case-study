# Cyclistic-case-study
Google Data Analytics CAPSTONE project

This is my final CAPSTONE project for the Google Data Analyst Certification. 

For this project, I have decided to work on the Cyclistic Bike Sharing service located in Chicago, where I will answer real world Data analyst questions following 
the data analysis process (ASK, PREPARE, PROCESS, ANALYZE, SHARE, ACT). My goal is to help the marketing team find some insights within a dataset.

The Case Study can be found on GitHub as a PDF File.
The SQL script has also been uploaded to GitHub
My visualizations for this can be found on Tableau Public :
