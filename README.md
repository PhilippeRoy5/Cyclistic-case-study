# Google Data Analytics capstone project
## Cyclistic Case Study

This is my final CAPSTONE project for the Google Data Analyst Certification. 

For this project, I have decided to work on the Cyclistic Bike Sharing service located in Chicago, where I will answer real world questions following 
the data analysis process (ASK, PREPARE, PROCESS, ANALYZE, SHARE, ACT). 

As a junior data analyst, my goal is to help the marketing team find some insights about the different types of users within a given dataset.
