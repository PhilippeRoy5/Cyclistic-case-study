# Cyclistic-case-study
Google Data Analytics CAPSTONE project

This is my final CAPSTONE project for the Google Data Analyst Certification. 

For this project, I have decided to work on the Cyclistic Bike Sharing service located in Chicago, where I will answer real world questions following 
the data analysis process (ASK, PREPARE, PROCESS, ANALYZE, SHARE, ACT). 

As a junior data analyst, my goal is to help the marketing team find some insights about the different types of users within a given dataset.

* The Case Study can be found on GitHub as a PDF File.
* The SQL script has also been uploaded to GitHub
* My visualizations for this can be found on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/GoogleDataAnalyticsCertificationCaseStudy/MAIN?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
